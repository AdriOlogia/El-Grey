          El Grey ID elevates Blockchain to register pieces of art. This
          technology allows for a secure way of storing information about the
          origin, name, techniques and materials of an art work. In this way,
          the physical object is linked to the digital world in a safe way,
          reducing the risk of counterfeiting.

          We use these immutable and cryptographic resources to generate a
          certificate that is easy to use, read and validate. Its tamper-proof
          qualities assure trust, transparency and anonymity among interested
          parties.

        <h5>What is Blockchain?</h5>
        <p>
          Blockchain is an electronic ledger that records a secure and immutable
          transaction of value, such as documents, certificates or money.
        </p>
        <p>
          The innovative thing about blockchain is that the transactions are
          distributed in a network and its modification is impossible once it
          has been incorporated.
