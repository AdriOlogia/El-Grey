whatwedo-title=What we do
whatwedo-content1=El Grey ID elevates Blockchain to register pieces of art. This technology allows for a secure way of storing information about the origin, name, techniques and materials of an art work. In this way, the physical object is linked to the digital world in a safe way, reducing the risk of counterfeiting.
whatwedo-content2=We use these immutable and cryptographic resources to generate a certificate that is easy to use, read and validate. Its tamper-proof qualities assure trust, transparency and anonymity among interested parties.
whatwedo-blockchain=What is Blockchain?
whatwedo-blockchain-content1=Blockchain is an electronic ledger that records a secure and immutable transaction of value, such as documents, certificates or money.
whatwedo-blockchain-content2=The innovative thing about blockchain is that the transactions are distributed in a network and its modification is impossible once it has been incorporated.
whatwedo-blockchain-beneficts=Benefits of an authenticity certificate in Blockchain
what-is-blockchain-title=What is Blockchain
what-is-blockchain-content1=Blockchain technology is similar to a shared database, it’s really just a sophisticated ledger system. Ledgers have been used since ancient times, long before computerization, where different mechanisms were used to record different transactions involving trade, property or other assets. While the concept of a ledger remained the same, the records have transitioned from papyrus to electronic records in a digital ledger.
what-is-blockchain-content2=The simplest example is carbon paper: this paper allows you to make copies of the same document or information instantly, ensuring that, for example, everyone involved has the same copy of a contract. Carbon paper has been an invention that gave confidence to the parties involved, since it is not the same to have the same copy instantly, at the time of writing, than to copy the same document twice by hand. Those involved are certain that the information contained in that record (ledger) is exactly the same, giving integrity to the data and trust to the parties. The Blockchain is like carbon paper, a trusted technology. It is basically a distributed database where a record of each transaction or exchange ever made, is kept.
what-is-blockchain-content3=A key component of Blockchain is its P2P or distributed network arrangement, which eliminates the need for a trusted third party or intermediary service to perform certain functions.
what-is-blockchain-content4=The innovative thing about blockchain is that the registry is distributed in each of the members that are part of the process and because it is not a centralized base, it is impossible to modify it since once a data has been recorded and linked to a previous block, the block is validated by the entire network in real time, giving confidence and certainty to all the nodes that make up the network (a key function of this technology). It is also thanks to this chain that events can be ordered in time, in order to provide traceability and transparency to any type of process.
what-is-blockchain-centralized=CENTRALIZED
what-is-blockchain-decentralized=DECENTRALIZED
what-is-blockchain-distributed=DISTRIBUTED
what-is-blockchain-content5=Centralized networks depend on a single controlling authority responsible for all operations on the system. A distributed database allows for all participants of the network to have a synchronized identical copy of the ledger; thus, when a change is made to the ledger, it is propagated and reflected in all copies held by the network participants, creating an immutable record of transactions. This makes unauthorized alterations significantly more difficult than they may be with traditional ledgers, which can be modified by a single trusted authority.
what-is-blockchain-content6=Each transaction, which can be any form of value, like money, documents or certificates, is added to a new block which is time-stamped and cryptographically ‘chained’ to the previous block that was added to the blockchain, which was chained to the block before it, and so on, all the way to the first block. Hence the name ‘Blockchain’.
what-is-blockchain-content7=For a transaction to be added to the ledger it has to have the consensus of an entire network, which consists of a chain of computers connected, thereby creating a continuous mechanism of control regarding manipulation, errors, and data quality. Once new data is entered it can never be erased. As blocks are only added to the blockchain with the consensus of independent nodes, there is no single point of failure through which the Blockchain’s data can be corrupted.
what-is-blockchain-strengths-title=Strengths of Blockchain:
what-is-blockchain-strengths-item1=<strong>Security / </strong>Being a distributed database it is almost impossible to alter or hack the information contained in the chain.
what-is-blockchain-strengths-item2=<strong>Integrity / </strong>Guarantees that the data has not been modified since its creation without the consent of those who participate in the process.
what-is-blockchain-strengths-item3=<strong>Chronologically updated / </strong> The blockchain is permanently timestamped, each block points to and refers to the data stored in the previous block in the chain, so all blocks are linked to each other.
what-is-blockchain-strengths-step1=A TRANSACTION IS<br>REQUESTED.
what-is-blockchain-strengths-step2=THE TRANSACTION IS<br>REPRESENTED ONLINE AS A “BLOCK”
what-is-blockchain-strengths-step3=THE BLOCK IS BROADCAST<br>TO EVERY PARTY IN THE NETWORK
what-is-blockchain-strengths-step4=THOSE IN THE NETWORK<br>VALIDATE THE TRANSACTION
what-is-blockchain-strengths-step5=THE BLOCK CAN THEN BE ADDED TO THE CHAIN,<br>WHICH PROVIDES AN INDELIBLE AND TRANSPARENT<br>RECORD OF TRANSACTIONS
what-is-blockchain-strengths-step6=THE TRANSACTION IS<br>COMPLETED
what-is-blockchain-power-title=The Power of the Hash
what-is-blockchain-power-content=Every block is linked together with a previous block using a cryptographic hash function. This is essentially the “fingerprint” of the data. A hash is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the data in question, much like your fingerprint identifies you. You can hash any data, whether it’s a file, data or a certificate of authenticity.
what-is-blockchain-hash-title=What is the Hash Used for?
what-is-blockchain-hash-content1=This is necessary for verification purposes to compare different data inputs. Imagine having a 300 document, I hash it and get an alphanumeric string, if I want to recheck it because I suspect it has been altered with, the easiest and fastest way without having to proof read the entire document would be to hash it again, if I get the same hash, then the document has not been altered.
what-is-blockchain-hash-content2=The process of creating hashes is one way only. These functions serve to ensure the authenticity of data since the hashes are irreversible.
how-is-certificate-title=How is a certificate created
how-is-certificate-content1=Basically, we encrypt the information of the certificate of authenticity, we get a hash as a result of that encryption, and it is that hash that we store on the blockchain. Source data cannot be reconstructed from hash stored on Blockchain.
how-is-certificate-content2=Certification process steps
how-is-certificate-content3=First, we take the information to be certified (source data) and through a procedure called SHA 256, we encrypt that information and obtain a hash (one-way alphanumeric code) as a result.
how-is-certificate-content4=Every time we want to validate that a certificate or certain information has not been altered, we carry out the following steps:
how-is-certificate-list1=We recalculate the hash of the source information, using the SHA-256 function.
how-is-certificate-list2=If the obtained hash matches the hash stored on the blockchain, then the information has not been altered, and the certificate is valid.
how-is-certificate-list3=If the obtained hash does not match the hash stored on the blockchain, then the source information has been altered and the certificate is invalid.
how-is-certificate-content5=The source information is never published on the Blockchain and is only stored on the organization's servers. Only the cryptographic function of that information is stored on the blockchain.
how-is-certificate-content6=Immutable certificates
how-is-certificate-content7=Blockchain is an immutable and distributed database, where each block of information is related to the previous one. When a certificate is issued, your data is compressed into a hash and registered on the blockchain. This generates a "receipt" that can always be verified at a later date. Our verification service validates the issuer's signature and the certificate data; It also ensures that the status of the certificate has not expired or has been revoked.
how-is-certificate-content8=The friendly version of the certificate displayed online can change visually, depending on the device that displays it. For example, it may appear one way in a mobile app and slightly differently in a web browser. Although this screen can be optimized for different circumstances, the data within the certificate can never be changed.
how-is-certificate-content9=Can issued certificates be changed?
how-is-certificate-content10=The certificates are immutable and once the information is registered, it cannot be altered. However, through El Grey ID you can revoke the certificates or define their validity time. The issuer can revoke certificates that have errors or simply omit a recipient.
